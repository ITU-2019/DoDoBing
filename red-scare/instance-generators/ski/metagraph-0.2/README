Welcome to METAGRAPH, a small set of macros that help in drawing
(un)directed graphs with METAPOST and the boxes package. Please have a look
at the included plain TeX manual: to compile it, however, you must first
run the examples.mp source file through METAPOST.

To use METAGRAPH, just put metagraph.mp somewhere in your path and input it
in your source file.

Comments are welcome.
