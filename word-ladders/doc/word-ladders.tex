\subsection{Description}
Find paths between given words among the five-letter words of English.

\subsection{How words connect}

We define a directed graph of words as follows.
There is one node for every 5-letter word.
There is an arc from $v$ to $w$ if each of the last four letters of $v$ appears in $w$.
For example, there is an arc from \emph{yodel} to \emph{lodes}, but not from \emph{lodes} to \emph{yodel} because the latter contains no S. 
On the other hand, there is an arc from \emph{sharp} to \emph{graph} and back. 
All four letters have to appear with repetitions, so there is an arc from \emph{where} to \emph{ether} (both Es appear) but not to \emph{retch} (E appears only once).
As an example, hereâ€™s a pretty long path in the graph:

\subsection{Requirements}

For a given instance {\tt words-xxx} you build a directed graph representing the adjacency structure of the words in the file called {\tt words-xxx.txt}. 

Then you are given a list of word pairs in {\tt words-xxx-in.txt}.\sidenote{A pair of words could be {\tt climb} and {\tt hames}, for example.}

For each pair of words you should output the length between these words, which should be computed with a BFS. The correct answers are specified in {\tt words-xxx-out.txt}.
Your algorithm should be able to both return the length of the shortest path \emph{and} a specific such path. The given output only shows the lengths of the paths, but for the report you will need to find an explicit path.

The data directory contains a number of test inputs with known distances, your algorithm must work correctly on all of those.

The running time of the BFS-part of the algorithm needs to be in $O(n+m)$, where $n$ and $m$ refer to the number of nodes and arcs in the underlying directed graph.  
Building the graph in quadratic time is accepted, but you should try to find a better solution.\sidenote{Of course, for dense graphs, $O(n+m)$ would be quadratic time anyway.
But the input graph is not dense.}

\subsection{Deliverables}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item The source code for your implementation
  \item A report in PDF.
  Use the report skeleton in the {\tt doc directory}.
  \end{enumerate}
